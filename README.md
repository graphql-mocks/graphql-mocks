## 👋 Welcome

Hello, you've reached the lerna mono repo for `graphql-mocks`.

Check out the [website](https://www.graphql-mocks.com) for an introduction on getting started with graphql-mocks.

The individual packages hosted in this repo can be found in the `packages` folder, they include:

- `graphql-mocks` (folder: `graphql-mocks`) — The main package containing graphql-mocks core functionality
- `graphql-paper` (folder: `paper`) - GraphQL Paper, an in-memory store using GraphQL schema. Can be used on its own without graphql-mocks.
- `@graphql-mocks/sinon` (folder: `sinon`) - Sinon spy integration with graphql-mocks, useful for test scenarios
- `@graphql-mocks/mirage` (folder: `mirage`) - Mirage.js integration with graphql-mocks, automatically resolve data with Mirage
- `@graphql-mocks/docs` (folder: `docs`) — Contains the documentation published at [www.graphql-mocks.com](https://www.graphql-mocks.com)

## 🏗 Developing

Clone the repo, then:

1. Run `yarn` to setup packages
2. Run `yarn bootstrap` to bootstrap package dependencies
3. Run `yarn link-packages` to cross-link packages within monorepo to respective package's `dist` folder

If changes are isolated to a single package then you should be all set.

If changes are in multiple packages where there is a dependency then changes will need to be rebuilt in dependent packages. Cross-dependencies are linked to `dist` folder in the dependency package-specific root (`package/*`) folder. It can be rebuilt by running `yarn build` in the dependency's root folder or `yarn bootstrap` from the monorepo root which rebuilds for all packages and is much slower.
