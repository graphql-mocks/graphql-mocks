# `@graphql-mocks/sinon`

This package provides a Resolver Wrapper for installing [sinon spies](https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/spies/) on specified resolvers. This is useful during testing to assert that resolvers were called a certain number of times or called with certain arguments, or other features provided by sinon. See the [documentation](http://www.graphql-mocks.com/docs/resolver/available-wrappers#spy-wrapper) on how to access and use the spies.
