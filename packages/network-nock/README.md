# `@graphql-mocks/network-nock`

This package provides a [Network Handler](http://www.graphql-mocks.com/docs/network/introducing-network-handlers) in the form of a Nock route handler to integrate GraphQL Mocks with [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock). This allows for writing mocks in tests against Nock, node-based network mocking.
