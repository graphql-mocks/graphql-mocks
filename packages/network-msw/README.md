# `@graphql-mocks/network-msw`

This package provides a [Network Handler](http://www.graphql-mocks.com/docs/network/introducing-network-handlers) in the form of a msw route handler to integrate GraphQL Mocks with [msw (mock service worker)](https://mswjs.io). This method allows for full GraphQL Mocking in the browser.
