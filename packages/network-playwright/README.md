# `@graphql-mocks/network-playwright`

This package provides a [Network Handler](http://www.graphql-mocks.com/docs/network/introducing-network-handlers) in the
form of a Playwright route handler to integrate GraphQL Mocks with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). This method
allows for full GraphQL Mocking in Playwright tests.
