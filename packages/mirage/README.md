# `@graphql-mocks/mirage`

This package was created to provide integrations with existing mocking environments that used [mirage.js](https://miragejs.com) for holding stateful data while mocking. If starting in a new project it is instead recommended to use [GraphQL Paper](http://www.graphql-mocks.com/docs/paper/introducing-paper), a GraphQL-first store, that is more robust when it comes to handling GraphQL data and integrating with GraphQL Mocks.
