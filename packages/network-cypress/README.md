# `@graphql-mocks/network-cypress`

This package provides a [Network Handler](http://www.graphql-mocks.com/docs/network/introducing-network-handlers) in the
form of a cypress route handler to integrate GraphQL Mocks with [Cypress](https://cypress.io). This method allows for
full GraphQL Mocking in cypress E2E and component tests.
