# `@graphql-mocks/faker`

This package provides a faker middleware and field resolver that can be used, along with the core `graphql-mocks` package, to automatically mock data with some applied heuristics, too. For more information and examples check out the [documentation](http://www.graphql-mocks.com/docs/guides/faker).
