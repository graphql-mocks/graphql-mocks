title: Introducing the gqlmocks CLI
---

The `gqlmocks` makes mocking easy with `localhost` mocking, setting up configuration defaults, generating file boilerplate, and verifying project setup. It's currently in beta as it's usage is tested and more integrations are added.

## Usage

The easiest way to use the cli is by using `npx` which will download and evoke commands from the package directly.

```shell
npx gqlmocks --help
```

## Next Steps
* [Quickly mock](/docs/cli/quick-mocking) using the `serve` command with zero setup
* Sensible defaults can be used by the CLI with a [gqlmocks config file](/docs/cli/gqlmocks-config)
* To get an overview of all the commands and their flags, take a look at the [Command List](/docs/cli/commands).
