title: Introducing the gqlmocks cli
---

As developers we've come to enjoy quick assistance from the command line and graphql-mocks is no different.
The `gqlmocks` cli provides a handy way to get started with generating graphql-mocks boilerplate files (like a GraphQL Handler), quickly run a mock local server on `localhost`, and more.

## Installation

Ensure that the core package `graphql-mocks` is installed, it will include a compatible version of the CLI.

Then using `npx` or `yarn` to evoke the CLI:

```shell
# via npm
npx gqlmocks --help

# via yarn
yarn gqlmocks --help
```

## Next Steps

* Sensible defaults can be used by the CLI with a `gqlmocks.config` file, learn how to set one up
* To get an overview of all the commands and their flags, take a look at the Command List documentation
