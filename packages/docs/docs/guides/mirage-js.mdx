[Mirage JS](https://miragejs.com/) is a great tool that makes mocking RESTful APIs much easier. One of the main benefits
of Mirage JS is that it provides a full in-memory database and ORM. This allows for mocked queries to be backed by
stateful data.

This library provides a few ways that to extend GraphQL with Mirage JS including "Auto Resolvers" or by using Mirage JS
within resolver functions, or a combination of both.

* [API documentation for `@graphql-mocks/mirage`](pathname:///api/mirage)

## Installation

Install Mirage JS and the complementary `@graphql-mocks/mirage` package

```bash
# npm
npm install --save-dev miragejs @graphql-mocks/mirage

# yarn
yarn add --dev miragejs @graphql-mocks/mirage
```

## Mirage JS Auto Resolvers Middleware

The `mirageMiddleware` will fill the Resolver Map with Auto Resolvers where resolvers do not already exist, unless
`replace` option is provided. To control where resolvers are applied, specify the `highlight` option. The Middleware
simply applies two types of resolvers to the Resolver Map: A Type Resolver for Abstract Types (Unions and Interfaces)
and a Field Resolver for fields.

```js
import { GraphQLHandler } from 'graphql-mocks';
import { mirageMiddleware } from '@graphql-mocks/mirage';

const handler = new GraphQLHandler({
  middlewares: [mirageMiddleware()],
  dependencies: {
    mirageServer,
    graphqlSchema,
  },
});
```

- `mirageServer` is a required dependency for this middleware.

Additional options on the `mirageMiddleware` include:

```ts
mirageMiddleware({
  highlight: HighlightableOption,
  replace: boolean,
});
```

## How Mirage JS & Auto Resolving works

Mirage JS can be setup where:

- Models and Relationships map to GraphQL types
- Model attributes map to fields on GraphQL types

For example:

```graphql
type Person {
  name: String
  family: [Person!]!
}
```

```js
import { Model, hasMany } from 'miragejs';

Model.create({
  family: hasMany('person'),
});
```

Associations between models reflect the relationships between GraphQL types. Relationships will be automatically
resolved based on the matching naming between Mirage JS models and GraphQL types. This provides the basis for the auto
resolving a GraphQL query. Auto Resolvers are applied to a Resolver map via the `mirageMiddlware` or can be imported
individually if required.

## Interface and Union Types

GraphQL Union and Interface are _Abstract Types_ that represent concrete types. The `mirageMiddleware` Type Resolver
provides two different strategies for resolving and modeling Abstract Types in Mirage. Both have their pros/cons and the
best fit will depend on the use case. The accompanying examples are a bit verbose but demonstrate the extent of setting
up these use cases. Both are setup with the same GraphQL Schema, query and return the same result. The `__typename` has
been queried also to show the resolved discrete type.

The GraphQL Schema for these examples is:

<AbstractTypeSchema />

This GraphQL schema has the following:

- Four GraphQL Concrete Types: `Movie`, `TV`, `Book`, and `Magazine`
- All four Concrete types are in a GraphQL Union called `Media`
- `Movie` and `TV` implement a `MovingPicture` interface
- `Book` and `Magazine` implement a `WrittenMedia` interface

### One Model per Abstract Type

In this case a Mirage model (`Media`) is setup for the Abstract type itself, and instances specify their concrete type
by the `__typename` attribute on the model, like `__typename: 'Movie'`. This option is easier and faster to setup but
can become harder to manage and requires remembering to specify the `__typename` model attribute on each instance
created.

<AbstractTypeWithTypenameExample />
<GraphQLResult result={abstractTypeWithTypenameResult} />

### One Model per Concrete Type

This option allows for each discrete type to be represented by its own Mirage Model definition. A relationship attribute
that can hold an Abstract type should specify the `{ polymorphic: true }` option on the
[relationship definition](https://miragejs.com/docs/main-concepts/relationships/#polymorphic). This option sets up for
distinct definitions but can also be more verbose.

<AbstractTypeWithDiscreteModelsExample />
<GraphQLResult result={abstractTypeWithDiscreteModelsResult} />

## Mock the GraphQL Endpoint using Mirage JS Route Handlers

A GraphQL handler handles the mocked responses for GraphQL queries and mutations. However, GraphQL is agnostic to the
network transport layer. Typically, GraphQL clients do use HTTP and luckily Mirage JS comes with out-of-the-box XHR
interception and route handlers to mock this as well. GraphQL API Servers operate on a single endpoint for a query so
only one route handler is needed. Migrating to other mocked networking methods later is easy as well.

Use `createRouteHandler` to get setup with a mocked GraphQL endpoint. Specify the same options as the `GraphQLHandler`
constructor or specify a `GraphQLHandler` instance. This example sets up a GraphQLHandler on the `graphql` route.

<RouteHandlerExample />

The `MirageServer` instance can be referenced by `this` within the `routes()` function and must be passed in as the
`mirageServer` dependency. See the
[Mirage JS route handlers documentation](https://miragejs.com/docs/main-concepts/route-handlers/) for more information
about mocking HTTP endpoints with route handlers.

Note: The rest of the examples skip this part and focus on `graphql-mocks` and Mirage JS configuration and examples.

## Relay Pagination

Use the `relayWrapper` for quick relay pagination. It must be *after* the Mirage JS Middleware. The `@graphql-mocks/mirage` package
provides a `mirageCursorForNode` function to be used for the required `cursorForNode` argument.

Check out the [Relay Wrapper documentation](/docs/guides/relay-pagination) for more details.

```js
import { GraphQLHandler } from 'graphql-mocks';
import { mirageCursorForNode } from '@graphql-mocks/mirage';

const handler = new GraphQLHandler({
  middlewares: [
    mirageMiddleware(),
    embed({
      wrappers: [
        relayWrapper({ cursorForNode: mirageCursorForNode })
      ]
    })
  ],
  dependencies: {
    mirageServer,
    graphqlSchema,
  },
});
```

## Examples

### Basic Query

This example shows the result of querying with Auto Resolvers against Mirage Models with relationships (between a Wizard
and their spells). It uses the `mirageMiddlware` middlware, sets up dependencies and runs a query. The mutations will
persist as part of Mirage JS's in-memory database for future mutations and queries.

<BasicExample /> <GraphQLResult result={basicExampleResult} />

### Mutations (Create, Update, Delete)

GraphQL Mutations can be done with static resolvers and a reference to the `mirageServer` dependency using the
`extractDependencies` function.

```js
resolverFunction: function(root, args, context, info) {
  const { mirageServer } = extractDependencies(context, ["mirageServer"]);
}
```

#### Create Example with Input Variables

This example creates a new instance of a Wizard model on the Mirage JS using a GraphQL Input Type.

<MutationCreateExample /> <GraphQLResult result={mutationCreateResult} />

#### Update Example

In this example Voldemort, Tom Riddle, has mistakenly been put into the wrong Hogwarts house. Using the `updateHouse`
mutation will take his Model ID, the correct House, and return the updated data. The `resolverMap` has a `updateHouse`
Resolver Function that will handle this mutation and update the within Mirage JS.

<MutationUpdateExample /> <GraphQLResult result={mutationUpdateResult} />

#### Delete Example

Removing Voldemort's entry in the Mirage JS database can be done through a `removeWizard` mutation. The `resolverMap`
has a `removeWizard` Resolver Function that will handle this mutation and update the within Mirage JS.

<MutationDeleteExample /> <GraphQLResult result={mutationDeleteResult} />

### Static Resolver Functions

Mirage JS can be used directly in static Resolver Functions in a Resolver Map by using the `extractDependencies`
utility. This technique can be with [Mutations](#mutations-create-update-delete), and Query Resolver Functions to bypass
Auto Resolving while still having access to Mirage. This is usually done when fine-grained control is needed.

<StaticResolverExample /> <GraphQLResult result={staticResolverResult} />

## Comparison with `miragejs/graphql`

Mirage JS has a GraphQL solution, `miragejs/graphql`, that leverages mirage & graphql automatic mocking and sets up
models on the mirage schema automatically. `graphql-mocks` with `@graphql-mocks/mirage ` do a few things differently
than `miragejs/graphql`.

- This library focuses on providing a flexible GraphQL-first mocking experience using Middlewares and Wrappers, and
  mainly uses Mirage JS as a stateful store. While Mirage JS focuses on mocking REST and uses `@miragejs/graphql` as an
  extension to provide GraphQL resolving.
- This library also does not apply automatic filtering like `@miragejs/graphql` as this tends to be highly specific to
  the individual GraphQL API. The same result, however, can be achieved by using a Resolver Wrapper, see
  [Automatic Filtering with Wrappers](/docs/guides/automatic-filtering) for examples.
- This library currently does not setup the Mirage JS Schema with Models and relationships based on the GraphQL Schema
  but aims at adding this as a configuration option in the future (PRs are welcome).
