The `pack` function can be used to manually apply Resolver Map Middlewares to Resolver Maps. This is especially useful
with an existing GraphQL Handler is already setup with a Resolver Map.

## Using `pack` with an Existing GraphQL Handler

If you are getting started and haven't set up a GraphQL handler yet, it is easier to use the library's GraphQL handler
[create a GraphQL handler](/docs/handler/introducing-handler) instead.

Otherwise, if you already have a handler set up you most likely can still use it with this library if you have a
Resolver Map. This library provides a `pack` function which takes an initial Resolver Map and applies operations against
it using Resolver Map Middlewares. The result of `pack` is a new "packed" Resolver Map that can now be used in your
existing GraphQL handler.

Here is an example that uses the third-party package, `graphql-tools`, and its handler.

<GraphQLResult result={existingHandlerExampleResult} />
