Ultimately, in order to be able to execute GraphQL queries you need a GraphQL handler. This handler represents your
GraphQL API and will take a query and variables and return a promise containing containing data or errors.

If you are just getting started with setting up your GraphQL API this library provides a GraphQL handler. If you already
have a GraphQL handler [use the `pack` guide](../guides/pack) to still be able to use this library's underlying
composibility features including Resovler Map Middlewares and Resolver Wrappers.

## Getting started

A `GraphQLHandler` instance handles GraphQL operations (queries and mutations). A GraphQL Schema is a required
dependency for setting it up. The Schema can be a:

- instance of `GraphQLSchema`
- GraphQL Schema AST (sometimes what is provided by babel loaders or bundlers)
- a string that is formatted in GraphQL SDL (Schema Definition Language)

A `GraphQLHandler` instance has a `query` function that processes queries and variables, returning the execution as a
promise with the result or any errors.

Here is an example:

<CreateHandlerExample />
<GraphQLResult result={createHandlerExampleResult} />

This example follows a similar path of creating custom resolvers that many GraphQL tutorials follow, especially those
for testing and mocking an API.

## Next Steps

To do this setup manual resolvers for each field on each type is possible but can take a bit of time and makes managing
the Resolver Map surface area a bit more cumbersome. This library provides tools to make this process easier,
whether there are common resolvers, static data, or automatic resolvers backed by a stateful source with [GraphQL Paper](/docs/paper/introducing-paper),
this library provides many ways to setup your mock GraphQL APIs. These are covered in brief in the next section with an example in the following section.
